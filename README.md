# ACNH-EDA
In this project, I will be exploring which traits make certain villagers more popular than others. Each villager has their own characteristics including gender, personality type, hobbies, and birthdays. Given the information from the datasets, what common characterstics can we find among the popular villagers?

The datasets I will be using were provided by users Jessica Li and Ampi on Kaggle:
